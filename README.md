# CHIIR 2025 Tutorial: Applying Large Language Models to Interactive Information Retrieval  

## Overview  

This half-day interactive tutorial introduces researchers to practical applications of **Large Language Models (LLMs) for Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR)**. Through hands-on exercises and real-world research scenarios, participants will learn:  

- How to integrate LLMs via APIs  
- How to evaluate their outputs in IIR settings  

The tutorial will help attendees **choose suitable models for different research needs** and provide them with tools to enhance their work. No prior experience with LLMs is required, though familiarity with basic programming concepts is recommended.  

## Learning Objectives  

By the end of the tutorial, participants will:  

✅ Understand the theoretical foundations of LLMs in IIR  
✅ Gain hands-on experience in running LLMs locally and via APIs  
✅ Learn to use LLMs for real-world research tasks such as **query generation, document relevance assessment, and user interaction modeling**  
✅ Develop a **critical perspective** on LLM capabilities, limitations, and ethical considerations  
✅ Stay updated on **recent advances in LLMs for search and retrieval**  

## Target Audience  

This tutorial is designed for:  

- **Researchers and students** (PhD students, postdocs, academics)  
- **Industry professionals** working with search technologies  
- **Human-centered researchers** in fields such as **human-computer interaction (HCI), conversational AI, and information access**
