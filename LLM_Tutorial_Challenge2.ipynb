The menstrual cycle is regulated by the physiological concentration of reactive forms of oxygen and nitrogen as redox signal molecules, which trigger and regulate the length of individual phases of the menstrual cycle. It has been suggested that the decline in female fertility is modulated by pathological OS. The pathological excess of OS compared to antioxidants triggers many disorders of female reproduction which could lead to gynecological diseases and to infertility. Therefore, antioxidants are crucial for proper female reproductive function. They play a part in the metabolism of oocytes; in endometrium maturation via the activation of antioxidant signaling pathways Nrf2 and NF-\\u03baB; and in the hormonal regulation of vascular action. Antioxidants can directly scavenge radicals and act as a cofactor of highly valuable enzymes of cell differentiation and development, or enhance the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Compensation for low levels of antioxidants through their supplementation can improve fertility. This review considers the role of selected vitamins, flavonoids, peptides, and trace elements with antioxidant effects in female reproduction mechanisms.\\nKeywords: vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin B9, melatonin, L-carnitine, resveratrol, quercetin, antioxidants, Nrf2, NF-\\u03baB, fertility\\n1. Introduction: Infertility Nowadays\\nOxidative stress affects many physiological processes, not only those involved in the reproductive system. Low levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RNOS) have a significant signaling role in the normal functioning of the ovaries (ovulation) and the endometrium of the uterus (decidualization, healing after the menstrual phase without scarring), and thus in fertility; stimulate energy production and angiogenesis; and regulate the inflammatory response in the female menstrual cycle. Chronic disruption of the physiological redox signaling activities necessary for the proper functioning of the female reproductive system can lead to the development and progression of gynecological, immunological, and hormonal disorders that lead to subfertility and infertility [1,2,3]. Infertility is a reproductive disorder defined as the inability to conceive after more than one year of unprotected intercourse [4] and affects 48 million couples worldwide [5] nowadays. Statistical data indicate that both male and female infertility account for approximately 45% [6] of infertility, and future prediction models show an even lower rate of new births [7,8]. Common infertility treatment methods include the surgical removal of defective tissue and hormonal supplementation [9] which are invasive methods used to \\u201cadjust\\u201d the receptive endometrium of the mother to allow the successful implantation of a competent embryo at the optimal stage of development as a key aspect of assisted reproduction technology (ART) [10]. The success rate of a single in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle is circa 30% [11] and this figure has not improved over the past decade [12]. One of the main tools for improving the female fertility rate is to decrease/normalize OS conditions to the physiologically desirable level and create a reproductive-friendly microenvironment via the right lifestyle and supplementation of antioxidants.\\n2. Female Reproduction Regulated by Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species\\nFertility is a complex process that comprises the decidualization of the uterine endometrium which is essential for the establishment of a successful pregnancy and which occurs in response to elevated levels of the ovarian hormones (estrogen\\u2014E2 and progesterone\\u2014P4) regulating the hormonal changes required for embryo implantation during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle [13]. This process occurs under specific physiological levels of RNOS related to the initiation of signals for interaction in the decidualized uterine endometrium, which is later exposed to extensive changes in oxygen tension during fertilization and pregnancy [14]. Undoubtedly, maintaining the balance between oxidants and antioxidants is important for the proper functioning of uterine physiological processes. Oxidative stress in general is a result of an imbalance between antioxidant capacity and the production of pro-oxidants such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (NOS) [14], but OS may significantly impact the normal female reproductive lifespan. Ovulation, oocyte maturation, ovarian steroidogenesis [15], luteolysis, luteal maintenance in pregnancy [16], the development of follicles and blastocysts, and blastocyst implantation as well as embryo development [17] are regulated via RNOS which fulfill the role of signaling. The RNOS signaling pathways involved in female reproduction such as mTOR, NF-\\u03baB, Nfr2/Keap1/ARE, FOXO, or MAPK/ERK, are affected by the level of RNOS [16]. The NF-\\u03baB signaling pathway consists of 5 transcription factors, namely RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-\\u03baB1 (p105/p50), and NF-\\u03baB2 (p100/p52) [18]. This pathway is regulated via inhibitors of \\u03baB (I\\u03baB) which are phosphorylated by I\\u03baB kinases (IKKs) and degraded by the proteasome [19]. The NF-\\u03baB dimers enter the nucleus and as transcription factor downstream pro-inflammatory genes (TNF\\u03b1, MIF, MMPs), cytokines (IL1/6/8), cell migration, and invasion genes (VCAM1, ICAM1, HCAM), as well as proliferation genes (WIAP, Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl) [18]. The activity of NF-\\u03baB is elevated by estrogen binding to its receptors activating several pro-inflammatory pathways such as CXL12/CXCR4, PI3K/Akt, or MAPK/ERK [11,14]. The overproduction of ROS is an important inducer of chronic NF-\\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses [20] which can trigger cells into pathologies. Under physiological conditions, the NF-\\u03baB subunit p65 and progesterone receptor are mutually repressed [21]. Progesterone inhibits the NF-\\u03baB-induced pro-inflammatory factors in endometriotic cells [18,21]. High mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) activates NF-\\u03baB via binding to its TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) receptor and induces inflammatory responses with sustained OS [22]. The HMGB-1/TLR4/NF-\\u03baB axis can induce the production of pro-oxidants (iNOS, NO), decrease the activities of SOD, GPx, CAT, and activate the phosphorylation of IKKs and the proliferation and invasion of cells [18].\\nThe endogenous ROS signal originates from inflammatory signals from macrophages and neutrophils which affect endometrial breakdown and repairment [23]. Progesterone withdrawal through ROS-induction stimulates the activity of NF-\\u03baB/COX2 signaling as well as cytokines (IL1, IL6, IL8, TNF-\\u03b1, etc.) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activation [23] resulting in an influx of leukocytes into the uterus and leading into the endometrial breakdown and shedding [16].\\nAn increased ROS activates the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor which binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter of the target genes to induce the expression of antioxidant genes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, glutathione synthesis and the genes involved in mitochondrial quality and quantity control [15,16,17,18]. The Nrf2 under physiological ROS levels is bound to Keap1, is constantly ubiquitinated via Cul3 E3 ubiquitin ligase, and is subsequently degraded by the proteasome [24]. In the case of elevated ROS, Keap1 is disconnected from Nrf2 and Nrf2 is translocated to the nucleus, where it is heterodimerized with sMaf and binds to the ARE which activates the transcription of its target genes [25].\\nOn the other hand, in OS conditions (Figure 1) ROS has a role in the regulation of NF-\\u03baB signaling as well as Nrf2 signaling, resulting in abnormal bleeding and uncontrolled apoptosis [14,21,26] in pathological processes and diseases such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and tubal and idiopathic infertility [27,28,29]. During pregnancy, increased placental OS can trigger pregnancy-related problems such as pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restrictions, gestational diabetes mellitus, or premature birth [30]. Elevated ROS initiates mitochondrial dysfunction and imbalance in the hormonal function of women [27]. Increased stress can stimulate the over-secretion of cortisol which can suppress the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) [31]. Suppressing the production of estradiol leads to the failure of oocyte maturation, resulting in infertility [24]. The ROS of respiratory chain complexes is physiologically generated mainly via complexes I, III, and IV [32]. In oocytes, ROS starts to build up as soon as complex I is assembled [33]. The dysfunction of respiratory complex I or overproduction of ROS leads to oocyte maturation failure.\\nOxidative stress (OS) is a stimulant (green arrows) of two main antioxidant signaling pathways-Nrf2 and NF-\\u03baB. Nrf2 signaling is involved in the expression of antioxidant enzymes, minimizing the effect of OS. NF-\\u03baB signaling is involved in the expression of genes for cells surviving under OS. Exogenic antioxidants (vitamins, trace elements, polyphenols, etc.) activate Nrf2 signaling and inhibit (red lines) the NF-\\u03baB pathway and eliminate exogenous as well as endogenous stimuli of OS.

Antioxidant Systems in Female Reproduction\\nThe human body has developed a variety of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems available to combat OS [17]. Enzymatic antioxidant protection consists of key enzymes, namely catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GSR), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), which are important in the prevention of lipid peroxidation and the maintenance of the proper function of cell membranes [34]. The total level of SOD (Cu/Zn/Mn-SOD) increases in the endometrium from the proliferative phase to the mid-secretory phase and decreases in the late-secretory phase, and on the contrary, lipid peroxidation increases as a physiological action of ROS [23]. Non-enzymatic antioxidants, mainly taken in food or endogenous biosynthesis, include polyphenols (quercetin, resveratrol, baicalin), carotenoids (\\u03b2-carotene, lycopene, lutein), low-molecular-weight antioxidants (glutathione, uric acid), trace elements (zinc and selenium), vitamins (A, E, C, B9), and others (L-carnitine, melatonin, acetylcysteine) [35,36]. The level of endogenous antioxidants is mostly stable and these molecules are only activated as necessary [37]. The exogenous antioxidants are received in food so their levels fluctuate based on diet [38]. This review focuses on selected non-enzymatic antioxidants in connection with the signaling pathways involved in female reproduction disorders.\\nMost antioxidants, in addition to their ability to scavenge radicals, activate Nrf2 and inhibit NF-\\u03baB pathways [11,26]. There is evidence that some antioxidants which naturally occurring in diet may have benefits for the female reproductive system. A list of selected antioxidants is shown in Table 1.\\nRecommended daily supplementation dose of some naturally occurring antioxidants for women in different cases (ARD mg/day).\\nExample Adult Pregnant In ART Role Source\\n[39,40] 0.55\\u20130.77 [40] 0.6\\u20135.8\\n[41] cell differentiation, antioxidant [34] sweet potato, carrot, tuna, pumpkin, kale\\n[39,40] 70\\u201385 [40,42] 127\\u2013167\\n[41] cofactor of oxidases, antioxidant, and wound healing process [43] guavas, bell pepper, kiwifruit, broccoli, papaya, strawberries\\n15 [39] 12\\u201315 [40] 8.5\\u201311\\n[41] antioxidant, modulates signal transduction, cell division, and cell membrane integrity [44] sunflower seeds, olive oil, almonds, avocado, spinach, butternut squash, kiwifruit\\n0.4\\u20130.6 [39] 0.4 [45] 0.2\\u20130.4\\n[41] coenzyme in single carbon transferase, aids in the production of nucleic acids [43] liver, yeast, legumes, pulses, fermented foods, and leafy vegetables [46,47]\\nSelenium 0.055\\u20130.06 [39] 0.05\\u20130.06 [48] \\u22640.075\\n[49] part of glutathione peroxidases, potent intracellular antioxidant enzymes [43] Meat, fish, milk, eggs, cruciferous vegetables, liliaceus vegetables, legumes, garlic, onion [50]\\nZinc 8\\u201311 [39] 9.5\\u201311 [40] \\u226418.6 [51] part of regulatory and catabolic enzymes responsible for signal transduction, gene expression structural role in zinc-finger motifs [43] oysters, beef, chicken, firm tofu, squash and pumpkin seeds, low-fat yogurt, and lentils\\n500 [52] 3000 [53] 1000 [54] facilitates long-chain fatty acid entry into cellular mitochondria [55] sheep meat, beef, pork, fish, chicken, cow\\u2019s milk\\napprox. 0.5\\u201310 [56,57,58] 0.3\\u20130.6\\n[41] 3\\u20136 [54,59] antioxidant [60], pro/apoptotic, regulates the uptake of growth factors, increases immunosurveillance, anti-angiogenic [61] cherries, walnuts, mustard seeds, poppy seeds, corn, rice\\n[63] 1200 [64], 30/kg [65] antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral [66], and inhibits cell proliferation [67] fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts\\nnot specified avoided [33] 60\\u2013120 [68] antioxidant, modifies cell morphology, gene expression, ligand-receptor interactions, signaling pathways foam-cell formation [69], and modulates innate and adaptive immunity [70] skins of grapes, red and white wines, apples, blueberries, peanuts\\n3.1. Carotenoids, Ascorbic Acid, Tocopherol, and Folic Acid Affect the Female Reproductive System\\nUnderstanding the mechanism of action of vitamin A, C, E, and B9 represents a milestone in the study of antioxidant properties [71]. Serum concentrations of antioxidants are associated with steroidogenesis and further elucidate the potential role of antioxidants in women\\u2019s reproductive health due to the protection the cell compartments from oxidative damage and regulation the physiological development of uterine and ovarian cells across a normal menstrual cycle [72].\\nVitamin E exists in eight isoforms, from which the \\u03b1-tocopherol is the most effective form and \\u03b3-tocopherol is the most common [73]. This naturally occurring fat-soluble vitamin acts as a scavenger of peroxyl radicals in cell membranes (affects the stability of the membrane and indirectly modulates the signaling properties of membrane proteins) and terminates lipid peroxidation chain reactions [73]. After the reaction with lipid peroxyl radical, a stable tocopherol radical is formed which undergoes reverse conversion to \\u03b1-tocopherol ensured by ascorbic acid or glutathione GSH [74].\\nVitamin E is involved in the alter expression of transcription factors to significantly decrease oxidative stress [73]. The AP1 (activator protein-1) transcription factor family, and the promoter regulatory element ARE, are involved in the regulation of redox homeostasis that can affect the NF-\\u03baB, MAPK/ERK/PI3K, and Nrf2 pathways (Figure 2) and modulate gene expression, including certain proteins that control cell cycle progression due to the reduction of PKC (protein kinase C), leading to decreased activation of MAPK/ERK (targeting cyclin D/E1, p27/53) and inflammatory response via inhibition of COX2, and they also regulate angiogenesis through the modulation of VEGF [73].\\nVitamin E (tocopherol) action in response to oxidative stress. It can stimulate Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2\\u2013related factor 2) signaling (green arrow) and cell apoptosis. Tocopherol can affect signaling of growth factors (Vascular Endothelial Growth factor, VEGF) and hormones (estrogen, E) by inhibition of PKC (Protein kinase C) (red line), which activates protein phosphatase, and dephophorylates PKC and inhibits its activity, which in turn leads to lower ROS mediated via uncoupled eNOS. Tocopherol also suppress E-dependent ERK activation (red line) via its ability to bind to the estrogen receptor (ER). On the other hand, vitamin E can inhibit apoptosis through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (red line).

As an antioxidant, it has benefits regarding reproductive diseases via improving endometrial thickness which is favorable in women with implantation failure [75]. Vitamin E in combination with other supplements such as zinc, selenium, iron, and L-arginine could increase the ovulation and pregnancy rate [41,47]. In addition to its antioxidant properties, it also has anti-inflammatory effects in reducing the production of prostaglandins [76]. Vitamin E regulates angiogenesis as well, as proved by significantly reduced VEGF in serum in women with PCOS [77].\\nAscorbic acid, better known as water-soluble vitamin C, is a part of the ascorbate peroxidases-glutathione reductase (APXs-GR) antioxidant system that can scavenge superoxide (O2\\u2022\\u2212) and hydroxyl (\\u2022OH) radicals, resulting in the formation of ascorbate radicals which act more effectively than the CAT or SOD antioxidant system [78]. Among its antioxidant properties, it fulfils its role in collagen synthesis, vasculogenesis, aging, cell proliferation, and differentiation [79]. From the two forms of vitamin C, the reduced form (ascorbic acid,) and the oxidized form (dehydroascorbic acid), only its reduced form has antioxidant capacity [36,80]. Administration of vitamin C to women with a luteal phase defect increased the level of progesterone in serum [81] and the pregnancy rate [78]. Ascorbic acid can compensate significantly for the adverse effects of aging in the ovary as was shown in mice [79], probably via inhibition of senescence through suppression of ROS production and AKT/mTOR signaling in mesenchymal stem cells [82]. The protective effects of vitamin C after exposure to oxidative damage lead to suppressed apoptosis by reducing the expression of caspase-3 or -8 in the ovarian and uterine tissues of treated rats and a decrease in the level of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), the marker for granulosa cells [83]. However, ascorbic acid also has a pro-oxidative effect which is associated with the interaction with transition metal ions such as iron and copper [84] and can produce O2\\u2022\\u2212 in the oxidation of the metal. Many studies were found regarding the antioxidant effect of vitamin E in combination with vitamin C in women of reproductive age with increased oxidative stress [52]. These two vitamins are promising in the prevention of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth [85], and contribute effectively to the reduction of pain in women with endometriosis [86,87].\\nThe antioxidant effects of carotenoid, fat-soluble vitamin A, consist of the absorption of peroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen [88]. Vitamin A was shown to be essential in several physiological processes, especially in reproduction, the immune system via an inflammatory response as it is related to the expression of cyclooxygenases, the generation of nitric oxide, prostaglandins [89], cell differentiation, vision, and bone metabolism [55,56]. Vitamin A participates in signaling during embryogenesis [57] via the induction of activation of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) transcription factors and their binding to RARE sites in DNA and also activates the expression of developmental genes (Figure 3) [90]. This positive effect on embryo development was confirmed by a study of the addition of retinol to the blastocyst\\u2019s culture media which improved the development of rabbit embryos [58].\\nVitamin A (retinol) activity in response to oxidative stress. Vitamin A is carried on RBP4 (Retinol Bindin Protein 4) protein and is translocated to the cell cytosol via its integral receptor STAR6 (Stimulated by Retinoic Acid 6 Receptor). In the cytosol, vitamin A is carried on RBP1 (Retinol Binding Protein 1). Vitamin A (retinol, ROL) undergoes oxidation on the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) to form RAL (retinal) and, via catalytic activity of ALDH1A (aldehyde dehydrogenase member A1 or retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1), to form RAC (retinoic acid). The \\u03b2-carotene can also be converted into RAL by \\u03b2-carotene 15\\u201315\\u2032-oxygenase. RAC enters the nucleus and binds to regulative elements on the DNA and affects the target antioxidant gene transcription. ROL can be converted via the catalytic activity of LRAT (Lecithin Retinol Acyltransferase) to its esters (ROOR) as well.\\nThe importance of retinoids in embryo development is via key embryonic signaling pathways such as Wnt, HH, FGF, and TGF. During the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, the demand for vitamin A increases [57]. Its deficiency is associated with an increased risk of premature birth and maternal anemia, and it is an important determinant for early lung development and the formation of alveoli in utero [91]. Further studies suggest that the detection of vitamin A and E in follicular fluid has a promising association with the status of the developing embryo, and therefore it could enable the selection of a competent embryo for transfer [92] during the IVF process.\\nFolate, a water-soluble vitamin B9, is a crucial coenzyme in transferring the methyl group in the so-called single-carbon cycle [93] and is necessary for the formation of red and white blood cells, nucleotide biosynthesis, DNA reparation, and the metabolism of amino acids [94]. Folate is comparable to vitamins C and E, and can also act as an effective antioxidant of reproductive health in vivo [95]. In female reproduction, folate is also important for oocyte quality and maturation, implantation, embryogenesis, placentation, fetal growth, and organ development during pregnancy [96]. Folate administration is related to the prevention of pregnancy-related disorders such as intrauterine growth retardation, neural tube defects, anencephaly, spina bifida, increased premature births, and miscarriages [45]. The oral administration of folate can reduce the number of immature oocytes in PCOS women undergoing IVF therapy [97]. In addition, concentration folate in follicular fluid significantly affects the pregnancy rate [98].\\nA summary of the antioxidant action of vitamins via regulation of Nrf2 and NF-\\u03baB signaling is showed in Figure 4.\\nA summary of vitamin A-C-E-B9 action in the activation (green arrows) of Nrf2 signaling and suppression (red line) of NF-\\u03baB signaling.

L-carnitine Ensures the Physiological Need for ATP in Women\\u2019s Reproduction Processes\\nL-carnitine (LC) and its acetylated form acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) are naturally occurring derivates of lysine and methionine amino acids. They play an important role in intermediate metabolism as they act as a cofactor in the transport of free fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix [66,67,68]. The supplementation of L-carnitine in oocytes and embryos increases energy production by \\u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, scavenges ROS, has anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects, and results in an increased pregnancy rate, as well as enhanced cryo-tolerance [99]. L-carnitine is converted to ALC in the mitochondria. ALC regulates the ratio of acetyl-CoA/CoA to maintain glucose metabolism via Krebs\\u2019 cycle and increases the utilization of pyruvate in gluconeogenesis [67]. Furthermore, LC can increase levels of vitamin C, vitamin E, and antioxidant enzymes such as CAT and SOD [100], and can prevent ROS formation in the respiratory chain via control of the transport of long-chain fatty acids (FA) to the mitochondria to facilitate their utilization by \\u03b2-oxidation [101]. Moreover, LC is involved in decreasing apoptosis by the inhibition of TNF-\\u03b1, IFN-\\u03b3, and IL-2/4/6, and in increasing the production of PGE1/2 which induces cytokine release and thus uterine defects such as endometriosis, and maintains their apoptic and inflammatory properties [101]. LC and ALC affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis to promote the secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus by increasing blood levels of estradiol, progesterone, and LH and, on the contrary, by decreasing the blood level of prolactin [102]. Due to its ability to improve the hormonal profile and metabolic parameters of women with reproductive disorders, the administration of LC to patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea improved the course of the disease [103] and reduced cytokine production. It also improved the hormonal profile of patients with endometriosis [17]. In women with PCOS, L-carnitine has a beneficial effect on ovulation and pregnancy rates, leads to improved endometrial thickness, and increases the serum estradiol level [104]. The reproductive potential (number of oocytes and viable embryos) in women undergoing IVF treatment [105] positively correlates with a high value of LC in the blood serum as well as in the follicular fluid [106]. The addition of L-carnitine to the culture medium improved oocyte and embryo quality as it is associated with \\u03b2-oxidation of FA which is capable of producing an enormous amount of ATP which is essential for oocyte maturation and early embryo development [69,73,74,107].\\n3.3. Melatonin Affects the Normal Hormonal Development and Functioning of the Female Reproductive Organs\\nMelatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a naturally occurring peptide hormone secreted by the pineal gland and multiple extra-pineal tissues (e.g., uterus, ovaries, and placenta) involved in the regulation of response to darkness, immune responses, inflammation, and microenvironmental angiogenesis [108]. Therefore, it is involved in the regulation of the sleep cycle and in multiple biological functions such as the metabolism of lipids, saccharides and the immune response [109]. Melatonin was shown to decrease OS, inflammation processes, and apoptosis [108]. It is directly involved in the detoxification of ROS and NOS, and is indirectly involved in the stimulation of enzymatic antioxidants and the suppression of pro-oxidants [110]. Melatonin was shown to downregulate COX-2 protein levels and upregulate SOD, GPx, CAT, and Bcl-2 activity, possibly via upregulating the Nrf2 signaling pathway [108]. Melatonin has an important role in female reproduction during childhood and puberty when it controls women\\u2019s reproductive endocrinological system [111] and affects the ovulation process [108]. Melatonin levels and fertility both decrease with age, [111] and these two processes could be linked. Upregulated E2 causes P4 resistance which leads to reproductive disorders such as endometriosis or PCOS [112]. Melatonin suppresses E2 production from the pre-ovulatory follicle via MAPKs, suppresses aromatase activity, and decreases the level of ER\\u03b1 in ovaries and the level of ER\\u03b2 in uterine tissue [108]. Some studies state that the concentration of melatonin is positively correlated with the number of follicles and follicle size in women undergoing IVF therapy and is also positively correlated with IVF outcome [113,114]. A decreased concentration of melatonin in the follicular fluid could be responsible for anovulation and poor quality oocytes in a patient with PCOS and, therefore, melatonin treatment can improve the quality of oocytes during follicular maturation [114]. Due to the antioxidant properties of melatonin, it plays an important role in neovascularization and angiogenesis via decreasing Ang-1/2, VEGF, and VEGFR expression during hypoxia. Due to its anti-angiogenic activity, it can reduce endometrial implant volumes in patients with endometriosis [108]. Melatonin can also inactivate MMPs (mainly MMP3 and MMP9), something which could also be beneficial in a patient with endometriosis [108]. Melatonin and its receptors MT1/2 are constantly expressed by placental cells to promote survival and syncytialization of the cytotrophoblast while reducing ROS and angiogenesis [112]. Melatonin supplementation for women with pre-eclampsia-related OS limiting hypertension [112] and patients with unexplained infertility can increase the pregnancy rate and embryo quality [30,31,115] via an upstream antioxidant Nrf2 activity and downstream activity of NF-\\u03baB [116,117].\\n3.4. Polyphenols\\u2014Quercetin and Resveratrol Have a Dual Function in the OS of the Female Reproductive System\\nWe would emphasize the importance of micronutrients in the diet, especially polyphenols, in the prevention and treatment of a wide range of chronic inflammatory diseases that can affect human fertility. Flavonoids are the most studied group of polyphenols, and are formed by two aromatic rings bound by three carbon atoms which form a heterocycle [118]. The most common flavonoids include quercetin, myricetin, catechin, and others [119]. Quercetin (3,3\\u2032,4\\u2032,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) has anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antioxidant properties [120,121]. Quercetin does not harm healthy cells [122] and could be an ideal agent for antioxidant treatment (it can reduce ROS via donating electrons) and is an inhibitor of cell growth and the cell cycle via various mechanisms [120,122,123] which is possible due to its antioxidant as well as prooxidant properties. Quercetin as an apoptotic inducer (at its high concentration) activates p53 and induces elevation of pro-apoptotic BAX, caspase-3/9, and also activates a reduction in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and survivin [122]. This polyphenol can enhance ARE binding activity and Nrf-2-mediated transcription activity to induce antioxidant enzyme expression [124] such as SOD, GPx, CAT, and GR [125] which protect against OS and inflammatory responses via inhibition of the NF-\\u03baB pathway [126].\\nOocytes cultured in a medium supplemented with quercetin showed better in vitro maturation and early embryonic development ability. The higher quality of the oocytes, increased the oocyte fertilization rate as well as the blastocyst-formation rate, and resulted in a higher number of high-quality blastocysts [127]. On the other hand, quercetin has shown an ability to inhibit the activity of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) which is present in the endometrial epithelium during embryo implantation [128]. Therefore, long-term use of quercetin as a supplement may have a mild adverse effect on female fertility [128]. It is known that quercetin, as a phytoestrogen, has a pleiotropic effect on the uterus as it has an estrogenic effect as well as an anti-estrogenic effect. At high doses it may pose a potential risk and trigger neoplastic changes in the uterus [62] as it has prooxidative stimuli and apoptotic responses.\\nOne of the best-studied naturally occurring non-flavonoid polyphenols from a group of stilbenes is resveratrol (3,5,4\\u2032-trihydroxystilbene; RSV) [129]. The positive effects of RSV in many diseases have been described as antidiabetic properties [130] and antimicrobial [131], antitumorigenic [132], antioxidant [133], neuroprotective [94,95] antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory action [134] via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and it also exhibits apoptosis. Resveratrol has structural and functional homology with estrogen and thus can bind to nuclear estrogen receptors (ER) and regulate their activity [135]. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), essential for immune response as the mediator of dioxin toxicity which induces immunosuppression, can bind with estrogen receptors or NF-\\u03baB and lead to an inflammatory response [134]. This non/flavonoid polyphenol affects signal transduction pathways such as AKT, STAT3, RPS6KB2, MAPK, PKC, and PPAR-\\u03b3 [134]. Resveratrol is a natural antagonist of AhR and can inhibit Th17 cells and also modulate suppression of NF-\\u03baB, IL-1\\u03b2, COX, and LPS to decrease inflammation and ROS levels [134]. This phytoestrogen can modulate ovarian function (oocyte maturation) and steroidogenesis and can protect oocytes from senescence-dependent damage by activation of the sirtuin1 gene (SIRT1) [136]. Activation of the SIRT1 leads to the elevation of LH (luteinizing hormone) receptors and ovarian GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) receptors, stimulating mitochondria multiplicity and viability to enhance anti-oxidative capacity [137]. RSV can modulate the reduction of inflammatory gene expression as IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1). While HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) are overexpressed in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis, and it can effectively inhibit PGF-2\\u03b1 which induces uterine contraction, leads to vessel relaxation and thus improves blood flow and reduces ischemia [137]. Resveratrol could also be promising in endometriosis as well as uterine fibroids as it significantly reduces the number and volume of endometrial implants [138]. On the other hand, it has an anti-deciduogenic effect in the endometrium, and therefore resveratrol supplementation should be avoided during the luteal phase and pregnancy [139]. In PCOS patients, administration of resveratrol significantly decreased total testosterone [140]. Resveratrol added to the culture medium during in vitro cultivation of oocytes increased blastocyst formation, reduced OS of vitrified mice oocytes, and improved oocyte maturation and embryo development [141].\\n3.5. Trace Elements\\u2014Zinc and Selenium and Their Fertility Effects\\nEssential trace elements in the human body are zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), copper (Co), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), iodine (I), manganese (Mn), and molybdenum (Mo). These are most effective in active sites of enzymes or as a part of transcription factors [142]. A deficiency in these trace elements (e.g., Zn, Se) is commonly linked with reproduction disorders such as endometriosis, PCOS [143], and pregnancy disorders such as prolonged labor, or pregnancy-induced hypertension [144,145].\\nZinc (in divalent form Zn2+) is the second most frequently occurring element in living organisms [51] and has an essential role in the regulation of several physiological processes of female germ cell growth, fertility, and pregnancy [143]. Zinc can occur in the cell in two forms, either bound with proteins, so-called zinc-finger proteins, or it may be present in association with some proteins in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and secretory vesicles [51]. Zinc fulfils an important function in maintaining endocrine and redox balance, inflammatory processes, glucose, and lipid metabolism, and in regulating cell proliferation, gene expression, and the immune system [143]. The direct antioxidant effect of zinc is mediated via metallothionein (Figure 5) in which Zn2+ is bound to sulphur residue in a reduced-protein form that can be oxidized and which releases free Zn2+ [146,147]. Zinc can stabilize the Zn-finger domain of NF-\\u03baB [148] where it acts as an alternative inhibitor of IKB [149]. As a transcription regulator of Nrf2, it can upregulate some downstream antioxidants through nuclear translocation and thus respond to damage caused by ROS [150]. Zinc, together with copper, is a cofactor for one of the most important antioxidant enzymes, Zn-SOD/SOD1 [151], which has a crucial role in women\\u2019s ovulation and menstrual cycles by scavenging ROS [152]. Additionally, Zn itself is a regulator of the zinc-dependent extracellular matrix remodeling endopeptidases known as MMPs [108,109]. Matrix metalloproteinases are involved in endometrium shedding, restructuralization, and decidualization [153,154]. They are essential in the early development of the preimplantation embryo as well as in the development of the fetus [51] via enhancing the activity of the STAT3/MMPs axis [155] In the invasion and migration of embryonic cells. Also affect the neurodevelopment of brain cells [156,157]. During pregnancy, a lower concentration of zinc is linked to prolonged labor, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and post-term pregnancy [143]. Zinc impacts mitochondrial homeostasis via its antioxidant and prooxidant properties [148]. A low concentration of Zn2+ affects mitochondrial biogenesis as matrix-related MMPs require zinc for maturation of protein. Furthermore, zinc is also an inhibitor of respiratory complex IV, redox-dependent pathways in the mitochondria and is involved in endoplasmatic reticulum OS and protein misfolding [148].\\nThe action mechanism of zinc and selenium in response to oxidative stress. Zinc can be released from metallothionein under protein reduction (formation of disulfidic bond after releasing zinc bound to sulfur in its oxidized form). Free zinc can act directly in reducing OS or can act via activation of Nrf2 signaling (green arrows) and can inhibit (red line) NF-\\u03baB signaling. On the other hand, selenium is incorporated in the amino acids lysine and methionine, and is used in the proteosynthesis of antioxidant enzymes and selenoproteins such as GPx which have the ability to reduce oxidative stress (red line).\\nAnother micronutrient which is important for the proper functioning of the body in terms of immunity, nervous system, muscles, and reproductive health is selenium [158]. Selenium, in a similar way to zinc, can act as an antioxidant via selenomethionine or selenocysteine, where selenium is mainly converted into selenomethionine and selenocysteine and is incorporated into proteins in place of methionine/cysteine which is essential for the synthesis of all selenoproteins (Figure 5) such as PGX, TXNRD, SEPHS2, SELENOF, SELENOH, and SELENOM [159,160]. Selenium mediates the inhibition of NF-\\u03baB, expression of inflammatory cytokines [161,162], and improves the antioxidant capacity via activating Nrf2, thereby alleviating the cytotoxicity caused by ROS [163]. As a component of seleno-proteins such as GPx and thioredoxin reductase, selenium has a crucial role in redox re-actions [134] in the uterus, granulosa cells, and follicles [164]. In addition to antioxidant properties, selenium also has anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, anti-carcinogenic, chemopreventive, and antimicrobial effects [165]. A reduced concentration of selenium in the blood of pregnant women is linked to a risk factor for subfertility [144] or can be linked to some defects in fetus development [166]. Selenium can suppress metritis and ovarian cysts [167]. A deficiency in Se is a cause of miscarriages and stillbirths [165]. The level of selenium decreases during pregnancy [168]. Insufficient selenium is also associated with decreased female fertility, probably due to its antioxidant role in the ovaries [168]. It has been proven that a lower level of selenium in follicular fluid is linked to unexplained infertility and premature ovarian failure in the use of the specific selenium-binding protein 1 [169]. Selenium from the follicular fluid is positively associated with embryo development, blastocyst formation, and embryos of high quality [170]. Selenium is potentially protective for trophoblast cells from excessive OS via the reduction of ROS through activating mitochondria biogenesis during the stimulation of trophoblast cells with selenium [171]. Some studies state that oral selenium supplementation improves embryo quality [172] and increases the number of good-quality oocytes in older women undergoing IVF therapy [173].\\nAntioxidants can counteract the damaging effects of oxidation in a living organism. The cellular antioxidant defense system protects cells from attack by ROS. There are three major types of ROS: superoxide radicals (O2\\u2022\\u2212), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl (\\u2022OH) radicals. Based on increased OS during the fertilization process and oocyte maturation, antioxidants are crucial for the proper functioning of female reproduction. Therefore, imbalance between excess of ROS and lack of antioxidants could negatively affect female fertility. In this review, the selected naturally occurring antioxidants exhibit improvement in the endometrial thickness of the uterine lining which is very important for the successful implantation of the embryo. Supplementing with antioxidants during the treatment of infertility might improve the outcome of assisted reproduction techniques. Some antioxidants are promising in preventing pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. The administration of antioxidants to patients with reproductive disorders such as PCOS, endometriosis, or functional hypothalamic amenorrhea improved the course of the diseases. However, not all antioxidants are recommended for pregnant women. Despite the positive effects of resveratrol and quercetin supplementation in gynecological diseases, it is recommended to avoid such polyphenols during pregnancy.\\nWe would like to give special thanks to Franti\\u0161ek Badovsk\\u00fd (co.

This research aims to clarify the connection between CDAI and the risk of female infertility by analyzing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2013 to 2018. Participants underwent two 24-h dietary recall interviews to calculate CDAI. Female infertility was determined through two questionnaires. Logistic regression model, restricted cubic spline and subgroup analysis were employed to examine the association between CDAI and female infertility. The study encompassed 2162 participants. Participants with female infertility had lower CDAI levels compared to those without. Following adjustment for confounding variables, a negative association between CDAI levels and female infertility was observed (Q4 vs. Q1, OR [95% CI] 0.392 [0.193, 0.795], P\\u2009=\\u20090.016). RCS demonstrated a statistically significant linear negative relationship between CDAI and female infertility. Subgroup analysis showed no significant interaction. This study illustrates a negative link between the CDAI and female infertility, indicating that higher consumption of dietary antioxidants may be associated with a reduced risk of female infertility. Additional rigorously designed prospective studies are necessary to validate these results.\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\nThe relationship between major dietary patterns and fertility status in iranian men: a case\\u2013control study\\nAssociation between composite dietary antioxidant index and hyperlipidemia in adults based on the NHANES\\nComposite dietary antioxidant index and obesity among U.S. adults in NHANES 2007\\u20132018\\nInfertility, characterized by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy following 12 months or longer of consistent unprotected sexual intercourse, represents a major public health issue worldwide1. It affected millions of women worldwide, presenting substantial challenges in the field of reproductive health. Epidemiological studies suggested that approximately 8\\u201312% of couples of reproductive age encounter difficulties achieving pregnancy2, with significant proportion of these cases can be attributed to factors specific to females3. The relationship between female infertility and oxidative stress (OS), marked by a disproportion between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body\\u2019s antioxidant defense systems, has garnered considerable attention4. OS is known to impact key reproductive processes adversely, including oocyte quality, folliculogenesis, and endometrial receptivity, thus influencing a woman's fertility potential5,6.\\nThe importance of antioxidant defenses in female reproductive health is highlighted by the impact of OS, with the composite dietary antioxidant index (CDAI) serving as a crucial metric7,8. The CDAI quantifies the cumulative antioxidant capacity derived from an individual's diet, encapsulating the consumption of a variety of antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, and E, zinc, selenium, and carotene9. A higher CDAI score suggests a dietary pattern abundant in compounds capable of neutralizing ROS, potentially mitigating oxidative damage within reproductive tissues10. By assessing the CDAI, researchers and clinicians can gain insights into how dietary antioxidants may influence OS levels and female fertility outcomes. Delving deeper into the specifics of the CDAI, it is important to appreciate the methodological nuances that contribute to its robustness as an index. The calculation of the CDAI is determined by the consumption levels of essential dietary antioxidants, adjusted for total energy intake to account for variations in dietary patterns and caloric needs among individuals11. This adjustment ensures that the CDAI provides a relative measure of antioxidant consumption that is comparable across different populations and dietary contexts12. Furthermore, the index considers the cumulative impact of antioxidants, recognizing that the protective effects against OS likely result from a complex interplay among various compounds rather than a single nutrient acting in isolation13.\\nThe utilization of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) enables a comprehensive examination of the correlation between dietary patterns and reproductive health within a heterogeneous sample population14. NHANES database offers robust, representative data that elucidate the nutritional habits and health outcomes, enabling the exploration of how dietary antioxidant consumption correlates with female fertility parameters. It provides a unique vantage point from which to examine the interplay between dietary antioxidant and female reproductive health. This research seeks to offer tangible insights that could guide dietary recommendations for women facing fertility challenges.\\nBaseline characteristics\\nThe baseline characteristics of the 2162 participants were presented in Table 1. The prevalence of female infertility within the cohort was identified at 13.46%. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between the infertility and non-infertility groups across various variables, including age, marital status, poverty income ratio (PIR), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), female hormones taken, body mass index (BMI), CDAI, vitamin C, Se, carotenoid. Compared to the non-infertility group, the CDAI, vitamin C, Se and carotenoid were markedly elevated in the infertility group. Furthermore, the infertility group demonstrated a higher combined prevalence of comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, DM, hyperlipidemia.\\nTable 1 Baseline characteristics of the study population.\\nRelationship between CDAI and infertility\\nTable 2 displays the findings of a multivariate logistic regression analysis that examined the relationship between the CDAI and the incidence of female infertility. In the crude model, there was no statistically significant association found between CDAI levels and female infertility (OR [95% CI] 0.948 [0.897, 1.002], P\\u2009=\\u20090.057). After controlling for pertinent covariates, a statistically significant negative relationship was observed in both Model 1 (OR [95% CI] 0.939 [0.889, 0.993], P\\u2009=\\u20090.028) and Model 2 (OR [95% CI] 0.942 [0.890, 0.997], P\\u2009=\\u20090.040). When CDAI was categorized into quartiles, this negative association persisted (P for trend\\u2009<\\u20090.05 in all models). In model 2, there was a significant decrease in female infertility in the fourth quartile compared to the first quartile (OR [95% CI] 0.392 [0.193, 0.795], P\\u2009=\\u20090.016). Similar results were also observed with vitamin C and selenium (Supplementary Table S1).\\nTable 2 The associations between CDAI and female infertility.\\nRestricted cubic spline\\nThe study utilized the restricted cubic spline (RCS) method to examine the relationship between the CDAI and female infertility. The results indicated a linear negative correlation between CDAI and the incidence of female infertility (Fig. 1). We identified a U-shaped relationship between vitamin A intake and the risk of female infertility (P for nonlinear\\u2009=\\u20091.82E\\u22124, inflection point: 710.033). Additionally, an L-shaped association between carotenoid intake and female infertility was also observed in this study (P for nonlinear\\u2009=\\u20090.011, inflection point: 17,041.49). Linear associations were detected among vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, and selenium (Fig. 2).\\nRestricted cubic spline model between CDAI and female infertility.

Utilizing data from the NHANES and adjusting for multiple covariates, the results revealed a negative correlation between CDAI and female infertility, suggesting a potential protective role of CDAI against the onset of infertility in women. Subgroup analyses revealed that the association between CDAI and female infertility was consistent across different groups. While no statistically significant interactions were found, the relationship was notably stronger in individuals with an earlier menarche age, heavy drinkers, and those without recreational activity.\\nAlthough the precise mechanisms through which dietary antioxidants influence the risk of female infertility remain unclear, it is apparent that OS plays a significant role in this relationship15. OS results from a dysregulation in the generation and clearance of ROS in cellular environments. The intrinsic antioxidant defense mechanisms play a vital role in counteracting OS in the female reproductive system, thereby preserving the integrity of normal reproductive functions and female fertility16,17,18. OS is implicated in a range of reproductive disorders, including ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and even early pregnancy loss19. PCOS is a common endocrine disorder and a leading cause of infertility, characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries20. OS has been shown to negatively impact oocyte quality in women with PCOS. The excess ROS can damage the oocyte's cellular structures, including DNA, lipids, and proteins, leading to reduced oocyte viability and developmental competence21. OS also impairs endometrial receptivity in women with PCOS. The endometrium, which must undergo complex remodeling to allow for embryo implantation, is particularly sensitive to oxidative damage. High levels of ROS can disrupt the expression of key genes and signaling pathways involved in endometrial receptivity, leading to an unfavorable environment for embryo implantation22. The endogenous antioxidant system, comprised of enzymatic antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidases (GPxs), is essential in mitigating ROS and safeguarding reproductive tissues against oxidative harm. The delicate equilibrium between ROS generation and the antioxidant defense mechanism underscores the significance of dietary antioxidants in maintaining reproductive health23,24,25. While the body possesses a robust system to manage OS, exogenous factors, including dietary intake of antioxidants, can significantly influence the efficiency of this system26. Adequate intake of dietary antioxidants may bolster the body's natural defenses, reduce oxidative damage, and thereby potentially lower the risk of conditions leading to female infertility27. The importance of vitamin A is highlighted by its involvement in the activation of the retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor transcription factors, its interaction with retinoic acid response element sites in DNA, and its promotion of gene expression related to developmental processes28,29. Vitamin C serves as a crucial antioxidant in the body's antioxidant defense system by utilizing the ascorbate peroxidase-glutathione reductase antioxidant pathway to effectively neutralize superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, ultimately converting into ascorbate radicals6,19,30. Vitamin E scavenges peroxyl radicals present in cell membranes, halting the lipid peroxidation reaction cascade. This mechanism is essential in protecting cells from oxidative damage, particularly in the lipid-laden milieu of cell membranes where peroxyl radicals have the potential to propagate lipid peroxidation, resulting in cellular dysfunction or demise31,32. Through neutralizing these radicals, vitamin E upholds the structural integrity of cell membranes, thereby safeguarding cellular function and viability7,33,34. The role of zinc and selenium in the body\\u2019s defense against OS is critical due to their involvement in key antioxidant enzymes. Zinc is a crucial component of SOD, which catalyzes the conversion of superoxide radicals into less harmful molecules, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage. Selenium is a vital part of GPxs, enzymes that reduce hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides, preventing the formation of free radicals that can damage cellular structures35,36,37,38,39.\\nThis study has some advantages. Firstly, the integration of data from NHANES serves to bolster the generalizability and practical relevance of our research outcomes. NHANES is widely recognized for its methodological thoroughness and its capability to deliver a sample that precisely represents the U.S. population, encompassing a diverse range of demographic, lifestyle, and health-related variables. This comprehensive dataset enables a thorough analysis of the relationships between CDAI and female infertility, while accounting for potential confounding factors. The inclusion of a diverse population sample allows for the exploration of these relationships across various subgroups. Secondly, the CDAI provides a comprehensive assessment that considers the combined impact of dietary antioxidants, departing from conventional methodologies that typically evaluate individual antioxidants in isolation. This integrated approach is crucial for capturing the synergistic interactions among different antioxidants found in the diet, potentially offering a more accurate representation of actual dietary habits and their influence on health outcomes.\\nThis study is subject to certain limitations. Firstly, the primary limitation arises from the cross-sectional design of the NHANES dataset, which hinders our capacity to establish causal relationships between CDAI and female infertility. Secondly, the reliance on self-reported dietary data in this study introduces the possibility of recall bias and inaccuracies in estimating antioxidant intake. Despite the employment of validated dietary assessment tools, the inherent nature of self-reported data may result in underestimation or overestimation of actual intake, consequently impacting the accuracy of the CDAI calculation and its correlation with infertility outcomes. Thirdly, the study's external validity may be impacted by the demographic and health characteristics of the NHANES participants. Despite NHANES' goal of representing the U.S. population, certain factors related to diet, lifestyle, or healthcare availability may be inadequately recorded or significantly differ from other demographic cohorts. Additionally, although the study's efforts to account for various potential confounders, there remains the possibility of unmeasured variables that could impact the association between dietary antioxidant intake and female infertility. Genetic predispositions and environmental exposures may also have a substantial influence on fertility outcomes, yet were not included in the analysis. Fourthly, a limitation of our study is the broad definition of infertility used in the NHANES database, which relies on self-reported data and does not differentiate between specific causes of infertility, such as PCOS. Although our findings offer insights into the general association between CDAI and female infertility, they do not specifically address the effects of CDAI on women with PCOS. Finally, the CDAI predominantly emphasizes the consumption of antioxidants, potentially overlooking other dietary factors, both nutritional and non-nutritional that may impact female fertility, including dietary fats, sources of protein, and the overall nutritional adequacy of the diet.\\nThis research presents innovative insights into nutritional interventions for addressing female infertility, particularly emphasizing the use of the CDAI as a metric for assessing the overall antioxidant capacity of the diet. The results highlight the role of increased dietary antioxidant intake in reducing the risk of female infertility. Furthermore, these results support the need for additional research on the correlation between dietary antioxidants and women's reproductive health, particularly in light of the potential for dietary modifications to serve as cost-effective preventive measures. This research underscores the significance of dietary antioxidants in preserving women's reproductive health and provides a solid basis for future research and public health interventions. More research is needed to understand how CDAI affects female infertility and how this can be used to develop targeted prevention and treatment strategies.\\nTo ascertain the correlation between dietary antioxidants and female infertility, our investigation utilized the NHANES database. This data comprises a cross-sectional survey intended to evaluate the health and nutrition of individuals in United States40. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the research ethics review board of the National Centre for Health Statistics. All participants in the study provided written informed consent. For the purpose of our study, we extracted data spanning from 2013 to 2018, encompassing a total of 29,400 participants. From this initial population, male participants were excluded from the analysis (n\\u2009=\\u200914,452). Additional exclusions were implemented according to age, specifically individuals under the age of 20 or over the age of 44 years (n\\u2009=\\u200911,241). Subsequent exclusions were based on missing data in several categories critical for our analysis: 373 participants had incomplete demographic information; 481 participants had missing data regarding infertility status; 472 participants had incomplete data for the CDAI calculation; and additional exclusions were made for missing data in key health variables: menarche age (n\\u2009=\\u200911), PID history (n\\u2009=\\u200915), female hormone or birth control pills usage (n\\u2009=\\u20094), as well as medical history including DM, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (n\\u2009=\\u2009121). Lifestyle factors were also considered, with exclusions for missing data in smoking and alcohol use (n\\u2009=\\u200973) and BMI (n\\u2009=\\u200911). The flow chart was presented in Fig. 4.\\nFlowchart of participant selection. NHANES National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, CDAI composite dietary antioxidant index, DM diabetes mellitus, PID pelvic inflammatory disease, BMI body mass index.\\nThe measurement of CDAI\\nDietary information and its components were meticulously gathered by well-trained NHANES personnel. Every participant completed two 24-h dietary recall interviews. Trained data collectors conducted a face-to-face dietary recall for 24 h, followed by a telephone recall 3\\u201310 days later. To reduce bias, the average antioxidant intake over the 2 days was used in the final analysis for a more accurate measure of dietary antioxidant consumption. To calculate the CDAI, we included six dietary antioxidants: vitamin A, C, E, carotenoid, zinc, and selenium. Subsequently, the intake levels for each antioxidant were standardized and summed to the final score. The calculation formula was described in a previous study41.\\nThe definition of female infertility\\nThe assessment of female infertility was conducted through responses to two specific questions in questionnaire: RHQ074 and RHQ076. A positive response to either of these questions qualified a participant as having a history of female infertility42.\\nA range of potential confounders were considered in our analyses to isolate the impact of CDAI on female infertility. These included age, ethnicity, marital status, education, PIR, DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, menarche age, regular period, PID, the use of birth control pills and female hormones, BMI, smoking and drinking status, physical activity, work and recreational activity. Data on these covariates were extracted from the demographics, dietary, examination and questionnaire data, ensuring a comprehensive adjustment for factors that might influence the study outcomes.\\nSample weights were appropriately applied in accordance with the recommended selection criteria to adjust for the intricate survey design of NHANES. For baseline characteristics, Weighted means with standard errors (SE) were utilized for the presentation of continuous variables, while weighted counts (percentages) were employed for the representation of categorical variables. Differences in categorical variables were assessed using the chi-square test, while the Student's t-test was utilized for continuous variables. We explored the association between the CDAI and female infertility using weighted logistic regression models. The participants were stratified into quartiles according to their CDAI levels, with the lowest quartile being designated as the reference group. A trend test was conducted to examine the linear trend across quartiles of CDAI risk estimates. Moreover, RCS was implemented to evaluate potential nonlinear associations between CDAI and female infertility. Sensitivity analyses were conducted through logistic regression within subgroups. Interactions between CDAI and each covariate were also assessed. Statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.3.1), with statistical significance defined as a P value less than 0.05.\\nThe dataset used in this research is available for public access on the NHANES website at [https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/].\\nCarson, S.

The aim of this study was to examine the link between female infertility and dietary antioxidant index (DAI).\\nThis case-control study was conducted on 125 women with recently diagnosis of reduced ovarian reserves (AMH\\u2009<\\u20091.1) as the case group and 125 women with normal ovarian reserve as the control group in Rasht, Iran. The amount of food intake was assessed using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and the DAI was calculated to estimate the antioxidant capacity of the diet.\\nRegarding dietary intake, the infertile women had a lower intake of potassium (2789.25\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009777 vs. 2593.68\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009443 mg/d, P\\u2009=\\u20090.02), magnesium (204.12\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200966 vs. 189.73\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200934 mg/d, P\\u2009=\\u20090.03), copper (0.93\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.40 vs. 0.82\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.20 mg/d, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), vitamin C (133.99\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200946 vs. 122.62\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200924 mg/d, P\\u2009=\\u20090.02), and fiber (14.53\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20093 vs. 13.44\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092 g/d, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and a higher intake of cholesterol (205.61\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200958 vs. 227.02\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200946 mg/d, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) than the control group (All P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The DAI was negatively associated with infertility (OR: 0.94, CI 95%: 0.88\\u20130.97, P\\u2009=\\u20090.03). The association remained significant after adjustments for age, BMI, the underlying diseases, fertility frequency, IVF failure, and calorie intake.\\nFollowing an antioxidant-rich diet may reduce the risk of infertility. More longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm these results and discover the underlying mechanisms.\\nThe inability to conceive after a year of consistent unprotected sexual activity is considered as the definition of infertility [1]. Approximately 70 million individuals worldwide are influenced by infertility [2]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), fertility problems affect 9% of couples around the world [2]. The evidence shows that about 8% of Iranian women suffer from lifetime primary infertility [3]. Reduced fertility can be the result of genital infection, endocrine disorders like polycystic ovary syndrome, genetic disorders, immunological factors [4], diabetes, thyroid disorders, maternal age, weight [5], and dietary intake [6, 7]. Recent studies indicated that dietary antioxidants may play a role in fertility and birth outcome [8] and reported the potential connection between oxidative stress (OS) and low antioxidant levels with infertility. The occurrence of oxidative stress is resulted from decreased antioxidant consumption and increased antioxidant utilization due to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).\\nThe findings of a review study indicated that the intake of recommended amounts of natural antioxidants may decrease OS and enhance female fertility [9]. Some researchers found that the consuming antioxidants such as vitamins C and E may lead to a shorter time to conception in women [10, 11]. Studies have shown that a lower daily intake of magnesium leads to damage to the female and male reproductive system [12]. In rats, retinol supplementation increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and also improved fertility conditions [13]. Moreover, a cross-sectional study conducted on infertile men found that selenium and \\u03b2-carotene intake were linked to higher sperm motility and higher semen volume. However, there was no correlation between zinc and vitamin E intake and semen parameters [14]. Dietary antioxidant index (DAI) has been introduced as a valid indicator for measuring overall antioxidant content in the diet (such as vitamin C, E, A, and Zinc, selenium, and magnesium) [15]. Various studies reported that DAI is associated with chronic diseases such as gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver, and obesity [16].\\nSeveral studies between antioxidant status and male infertility have been done [17,18,19]. However, there are few studies on the effect of dietary antioxidants on female infertility, and a firm association between infertility in women and DAI has not been yet established. So, the present study aimed to investigate the association between female infertility and DAI.\\nThis case-control study was conducted in 2022\\u20132023 on infertile patients referred to the infertility clinic of Al-Zahra Hospital, Rasht, Iran. By using the consecutive sampling method, people referred to the infertility center who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study from the baseline until the required sample size was completed. After obtaining informed consent, 125 women with recently diagnosis of reduced ovarian reserves (AMH\\u2009<\\u20091.1) without previous therapies for ovarian stimulation were recruited as the cases, and 125 women categorically matched for age and body mass index (BMI) but with normal ovarian reserve and with problems in male fertility factor were included as the controls. The sample size was calculated as 246 individuals using Open EPI [23] according to the odds ratio obtained in a previous similar study [24].\\nInclusion criteria for the case group were women aged 18 to 40 years with primary or secondary infertility, who consented to participate in the study, and were clinically diagnosed by a gynecologist no more than 3 months ago. Exclusion criteria were included use of drugs affecting the absorption of dietary antioxidants, the use of drugs that inhibit digestive enzymes such as Orlistat, the use of probiotics and/or prebiotics, suffering from diseases affecting the absorption of dietary antioxidants including people with malabsorption and other gastrointestinal problems e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel diseases.\\nThe data collection instruments include a general and a pathological questionnaire, as well as a 168-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that reflects the food items consumed during last 12 months. The general questionnaire included data on age, education level, occupation, height, weight, and BMI. Data on medical history, history of medication use, consumption of nutritional supplements, hormonal status (including AMH-FSH-LH), and BMI was also collected.\\nThe amount of food intake was assessed using the FFQ questionnaire which has confirmed validity and reliability in the Iranian population [20]. The FFQ consists of 168 food items and was completed to assess the dietary intake of antioxidants during the last year. The information collected by FFQ was transferred to the Nutritionist IV software to evaluate the amount of the intake of macronutrients and micronutrients during a day. Then, the Dietary Antioxidant Index (DAI) was calculated using the method proposed by Wright et al. [21] to estimate the antioxidant capacity of the diet. DAI is a simple and functional method to evaluate diet quality based on dietary antioxidants [22]. The components of DAI are dietary antioxidants including vitamins A, E, C, and selenium, magnesium and zinc. To compute the DAI, the mean intake of vitamins A, C, E, and magnesium, selenium, and zinc is subtracted from the intake of each item individually, and the obtained value is divided by the standard deviation of global intake, yielding the standard value for each item. Finally, the standard value of the items (six items) is summed together to obtain the DAI score, as shown below:\\n{\\\\text{DAI}}=\\\\sum _{i=1}^{n=6}.\\\\frac{individual\\\\,intake\\\\,-\\\\,global\\\\,mean}{global\\\\,SD}\\nThe t-test (for quantitative variables) and the chi-square test (for qualitative variables) were used to compare the socio-demographic status and food intake of the case and control groups. The association between DAI and infertility was evaluated using logistic regression. The effect of background and confounding variables including age (as quantitative), weight, BMI (as quantitative), consumption of antioxidant supplements, underlying diseases, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity were adjusted in different regression models. SPSS version 21 was used for data analysis, and the significance level for all analyses was considered as P\\u2009<\\u20090.05.\\nEthical considerations\\nParticipants had the option to participate and leave the study whenever they wanted. The demographic, obstetric, and clinical information remained confidential and all documents were kept in a safe place exclusively accessible by the researchers. The ethical considerations of the present study were approved by the ethics committee of Gilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran (Code: IR.GUMS.REC.1401.147).\\nThe general characteristics and the status of the female sex hormones of the participants are presented in Table 1. The case group had significantly lower AMH (0.52\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.79 vs. 2.30\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.76 ng/mL, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and higher mean of FSH (14.46\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200918.82 vs. 9.06\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20098.07 mIU/mL, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and LH (8.03\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200910.03 vs. 6.03\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20094.32 mIU/mL, P\\u2009=\\u20090.043) compared to the control group.\\nTable 1 The characteristics of the participants\\nTable 2 shows the comparison of dietary intake of nutrients between the case and control groups. The case group had higher intake of cholesterol (227.02\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200946.05 vs. 205.61\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200958.88 mg/d, P\\u2009=\\u20090.002) and lower intake of potassium (2593.68\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009443.62 vs. 2789.25\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009777.93 mg/d, p\\u2009=\\u20090.02), magnesium (189.73\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200934.78 vs. 204.12\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200966.94 mg/d, p\\u2009=\\u20090.03), coper (0.82\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.20 vs. 0.93\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.40 mg/d, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), vitamin C (122.62\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200924.48 vs. 133.99\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200946.44 mg/d, P\\u2009=\\u20090.02) and fiber (13.44\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092.12 vs. 14.53\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20093.79 g/d, P\\u2009=\\u20090.005) compared to the control group. The groups did not differ in their intake of other dietary nutrients.\\nTable 2 Dietary nutrients intake among the case and control groups\\nThe amounts of DAI among the case and control group are presented in Table 3. The case group had lower DAI of magnesium (-0.13\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.65 vs. 0.13\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.25 mg/d, P\\u2009=\\u20090.03), vitamin C (-0.15\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.65 vs. 0.15\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.24 mg/d, P\\u2009=\\u20090.02) and total DAI (-0.57\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20093.49 vs. 0.65\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20095.34 mg/d, P\\u2009=\\u20090.03) than the control group. There are no differences between cases and control group regarding to the DAI of Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Zinc and selenium.\\nTable 3 The amounts of DAI among the case and control groups\\nThe association between infertility and DAI is presented in Table 4. An inverse association was observed between the DAI and infertility (OR: 0.94, CI 95%: 0.88\\u20130.97, P\\u2009=\\u20090.03). The association remained significant after adjustment for age, BMI, the underlying diseases, fertility frequency, and IVF failure (OR: 0.94, CI 95%: 0.89\\u20130.98, P\\u2009=\\u20090.04) (Model 2), and after additional adjustment for calorie intake (OR: 0.93, CI 95%: 0.86\\u20130.97, P\\u2009=\\u20090.04) (Model 3).\\nTable 4 Logistic regression of the association between infertility and DAI\\nThe aim of the study was to explore the link between female infertility and the DAI in Iranian women. Regarding the intake of dietary components, the infertile women had a lower significant potassium, magnesium, copper, vitamin C, and fiber intake, and a higher significant cholesterol intake than the control group. In addition, the mean of DAI was higher in the control groups. Our study also showed that DAI was negatively associated with infertility. Therefore, women with higher DAI scores (Implying a noteworthy intake of dietary antioxidants) were found to have a lower risk of infertility. Considering that high dietary quality will result in a high intake of micronutrients with antioxidant activity; thereby a high quality diet may protect against female infertility.\\nThe beneficial effects of some dietary components on infertility were frequently reported [23]. Some studies investigated the association of the DAI components including several types of antioxidants and infertility [9, 24, 25]. The DAI takes into account all dietary antioxidants and their combined effects, rather than analyzing each component separately [26]. Given its strong correlation with serum antioxidant levels, the DAI provides a comprehensive evaluation of dietary antioxidants. In line with our results, various studies reported the association of antioxidants with infertility. Elizabeth et al. [10] assessed the association between dietary antioxidant intake among couples treated for infertility and reported that the intake of the antioxidants such as vitamin C, b-carotene, and vitamin E is related to fertility in women. Another study on the effect of a high antioxidant diet in women with endometriosis [27] reported that infertility is accompanied with higher oxidative stress and antioxidant exhaustion mechanisms, and demonstrated that the daily intake of vitamins C, E, and A is lower in women with infertility compared to other women. Jessica et al. [28] examined the association of maternal plasma concentrations of zinc, copper, and selenium, and time to pregnancy and subfertility and reported that lower selenium and zinc serum concentration is inversely associated with fertility, while there was no relationship with copper. In general, some previous studies found a link between antioxidants status and infertility, but there are discrepancies in the methods used to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of the diet. Based on the results of the present study, the DAI may be a useful tool for evaluating total dietary antioxidant capacity [29].\\nThe exact molecular mechanism of the effects of antioxidants on infertility is not clear. Unexplained infertility may be caused by a disruption of the balance between ROS and antioxidant levels [30]. Vitamin C plays a key role in collagen synthesis in the extracellular matrix of the corpus luteum and the production of progestin needed to maintain the endometrium tissue development [31]. Furthermore, vitamin E helps protect the ovarian surface epithelium from oxidative damage [32, 33]. Hence, enhanced ovarian vitamin E levels help the protection of the aging ovary during luteolysis and the reduction of the ability of luteal cell to eliminate OS [34]. The function of estrogen is depended on magnesium, which aids in the binding of FSH (hormone stimulating the ovaries) to ovary receptors. A lack of magnesium is linked to increased smooth muscle cell tone, which can obstruct a healthy fallopian tube [35, 36].\\nOverall, the present study had several strengths. First, this study is the first to explore the connection between a new indicator for evaluating antioxidant properties of diet and the risk of female infertility. To our knowledge, no other study has employed the DAI to assess the chances of female infertility, making it challenging to compare results but confirming the novelty of this research. Second, using regression models in this matched case-control study and considering different confounders improved the obtained results.\\nHowever, this study had some limitations. One of our study\\u2019s limitations was probability of over-estimation and under-estimation due to using self-report FFQ for dietary assessment. Moreover, although there are many nutrients and non-nutritive dietary components that may have antioxidant roles, the DAI indicator includes only six essential micronutrients with antioxidant properties.\\nAccording to this study, DAI can be a practical and effective tool in assessing antioxidant status of diet. Receiving antioxidant-rich foods may decrease the risk of infertility. Based on our research, in order to reduce the odds of infertility, the consumption of antioxidant through the diet is recommended. Hence, following a diet rich in antioxidants can be considered as a useful strategy to reduce the risk of infertility. More studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm the results of the present study and to discover the underlying mechanisms. In addition, future intervention studies are required before recommending antioxidant supplements against infertility.\\nThe datasets used and analyzed during the current study available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\\nCarson SA, Kallen AN.

This research aims to clarify the connection between CDAI and the risk of female infertility by analyzing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2013 to 2018. Participants underwent two 24-h dietary recall interviews to calculate CDAI. Female infertility was determined through two questionnaires. Logistic regression model, restricted cubic spline and subgroup analysis were employed to examine the association between CDAI and female infertility. The study encompassed 2162 participants. Participants with female infertility had lower CDAI levels compared to those without. Following adjustment for confounding variables, a negative association between CDAI levels and female infertility was observed (Q4 vs. Q1, OR [95% CI] 0.392 [0.193, 0.795], P\\u2009=\\u20090.016). RCS demonstrated a statistically significant linear negative relationship between CDAI and female infertility. Subgroup analysis showed no significant interaction. This study illustrates a negative link between the CDAI and female infertility, indicating that higher consumption of dietary antioxidants may be associated with a reduced risk of female infertility. Additional rigorously designed prospective studies are necessary to validate these results.\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\nThe relationship between major dietary patterns and fertility status in iranian men: a case\\u2013control study\\nAssociation between composite dietary antioxidant index and hyperlipidemia in adults based on the NHANES\\nComposite dietary antioxidant index and obesity among U.S. adults in NHANES 2007\\u20132018\\nInfertility, characterized by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy following 12 months or longer of consistent unprotected sexual intercourse, represents a major public health issue worldwide1. It affected millions of women worldwide, presenting substantial challenges in the field of reproductive health. Epidemiological studies suggested that approximately 8\\u201312% of couples of reproductive age encounter difficulties achieving pregnancy2, with significant proportion of these cases can be attributed to factors specific to females3. The relationship between female infertility and oxidative stress (OS), marked by a disproportion between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body\\u2019s antioxidant defense systems, has garnered considerable attention4. OS is known to impact key reproductive processes adversely, including oocyte quality, folliculogenesis, and endometrial receptivity, thus influencing a woman's fertility potential5,6.\\nThe importance of antioxidant defenses in female reproductive health is highlighted by the impact of OS, with the composite dietary antioxidant index (CDAI) serving as a crucial metric7,8. The CDAI quantifies the cumulative antioxidant capacity derived from an individual's diet, encapsulating the consumption of a variety of antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, and E, zinc, selenium, and carotene9. A higher CDAI score suggests a dietary pattern abundant in compounds capable of neutralizing ROS, potentially mitigating oxidative damage within reproductive tissues10. By assessing the CDAI, researchers and clinicians can gain insights into how dietary antioxidants may influence OS levels and female fertility outcomes. Delving deeper into the specifics of the CDAI, it is important to appreciate the methodological nuances that contribute to its robustness as an index. The calculation of the CDAI is determined by the consumption levels of essential dietary antioxidants, adjusted for total energy intake to account for variations in dietary patterns and caloric needs among individuals11. This adjustment ensures that the CDAI provides a relative measure of antioxidant consumption that is comparable across different populations and dietary contexts12. Furthermore, the index considers the cumulative impact of antioxidants, recognizing that the protective effects against OS likely result from a complex interplay among various compounds rather than a single nutrient acting in isolation13.\\nThe utilization of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) enables a comprehensive examination of the correlation between dietary patterns and reproductive health within a heterogeneous sample population14. NHANES database offers robust, representative data that elucidate the nutritional habits and health outcomes, enabling the exploration of how dietary antioxidant consumption correlates with female fertility parameters. It provides a unique vantage point from which to examine the interplay between dietary antioxidant and female reproductive health. This research seeks to offer tangible insights that could guide dietary recommendations for women facing fertility challenges.\\nBaseline characteristics\\nThe baseline characteristics of the 2162 participants were presented in Table 1. The prevalence of female infertility within the cohort was identified at 13.46%. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between the infertility and non-infertility groups across various variables, including age, marital status, poverty income ratio (PIR), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), female hormones taken, body mass index (BMI), CDAI, vitamin C, Se, carotenoid. Compared to the non-infertility group, the CDAI, vitamin C, Se and carotenoid were markedly elevated in the infertility group. Furthermore, the infertility group demonstrated a higher combined prevalence of comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, DM, hyperlipidemia.\\nTable 1 Baseline characteristics of the study population.\\nRelationship between CDAI and infertility\\nTable 2 displays the findings of a multivariate logistic regression analysis that examined the relationship between the CDAI and the incidence of female infertility. In the crude model, there was no statistically significant association found between CDAI levels and female infertility (OR [95% CI] 0.948 [0.897, 1.002], P\\u2009=\\u20090.057). After controlling for pertinent covariates, a statistically significant negative relationship was observed in both Model 1 (OR [95% CI] 0.939 [0.889, 0.993], P\\u2009=\\u20090.028) and Model 2 (OR [95% CI] 0.942 [0.890, 0.997], P\\u2009=\\u20090.040). When CDAI was categorized into quartiles, this negative association persisted (P for trend\\u2009<\\u20090.05 in all models). In model 2, there was a significant decrease in female infertility in the fourth quartile compared to the first quartile (OR [95% CI] 0.392 [0.193, 0.795], P\\u2009=\\u20090.016). Similar results were also observed with vitamin C and selenium (Supplementary Table S1).\\nTable 2 The associations between CDAI and female infertility.\\nRestricted cubic spline\\nThe study utilized the restricted cubic spline (RCS) method to examine the relationship between the CDAI and female infertility. The results indicated a linear negative correlation between CDAI and the incidence of female infertility (Fig. 1). We identified a U-shaped relationship between vitamin A intake and the risk of female infertility (P for nonlinear\\u2009=\\u20091.82E\\u22124, inflection point: 710.033). Additionally, an L-shaped association between carotenoid intake and female infertility was also observed in this study (P for nonlinear\\u2009=\\u20090.011, inflection point: 17,041.49). Linear associations were detected among vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, and selenium (Fig. 2).\\nRestricted cubic spline model between CDAI and female infertility.

Utilizing data from the NHANES and adjusting for multiple covariates, the results revealed a negative correlation between CDAI and female infertility, suggesting a potential protective role of CDAI against the onset of infertility in women. Subgroup analyses revealed that the association between CDAI and female infertility was consistent across different groups. While no statistically significant interactions were found, the relationship was notably stronger in individuals with an earlier menarche age, heavy drinkers, and those without recreational activity.\\nAlthough the precise mechanisms through which dietary antioxidants influence the risk of female infertility remain unclear, it is apparent that OS plays a significant role in this relationship15. OS results from a dysregulation in the generation and clearance of ROS in cellular environments. The intrinsic antioxidant defense mechanisms play a vital role in counteracting OS in the female reproductive system, thereby preserving the integrity of normal reproductive functions and female fertility16,17,18. OS is implicated in a range of reproductive disorders, including ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and even early pregnancy loss19. PCOS is a common endocrine disorder and a leading cause of infertility, characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries20. OS has been shown to negatively impact oocyte quality in women with PCOS. The excess ROS can damage the oocyte's cellular structures, including DNA, lipids, and proteins, leading to reduced oocyte viability and developmental competence21. OS also impairs endometrial receptivity in women with PCOS. The endometrium, which must undergo complex remodeling to allow for embryo implantation, is particularly sensitive to oxidative damage. High levels of ROS can disrupt the expression of key genes and signaling pathways involved in endometrial receptivity, leading to an unfavorable environment for embryo implantation22. The endogenous antioxidant system, comprised of enzymatic antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidases (GPxs), is essential in mitigating ROS and safeguarding reproductive tissues against oxidative harm. The delicate equilibrium between ROS generation and the antioxidant defense mechanism underscores the significance of dietary antioxidants in maintaining reproductive health23,24,25. While the body possesses a robust system to manage OS, exogenous factors, including dietary intake of antioxidants, can significantly influence the efficiency of this system26. Adequate intake of dietary antioxidants may bolster the body's natural defenses, reduce oxidative damage, and thereby potentially lower the risk of conditions leading to female infertility27. The importance of vitamin A is highlighted by its involvement in the activation of the retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor transcription factors, its interaction with retinoic acid response element sites in DNA, and its promotion of gene expression related to developmental processes28,29. Vitamin C serves as a crucial antioxidant in the body's antioxidant defense system by utilizing the ascorbate peroxidase-glutathione reductase antioxidant pathway to effectively neutralize superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, ultimately converting into ascorbate radicals6,19,30. Vitamin E scavenges peroxyl radicals present in cell membranes, halting the lipid peroxidation reaction cascade. This mechanism is essential in protecting cells from oxidative damage, particularly in the lipid-laden milieu of cell membranes where peroxyl radicals have the potential to propagate lipid peroxidation, resulting in cellular dysfunction or demise31,32. Through neutralizing these radicals, vitamin E upholds the structural integrity of cell membranes, thereby safeguarding cellular function and viability7,33,34. The role of zinc and selenium in the body\\u2019s defense against OS is critical due to their involvement in key antioxidant enzymes. Zinc is a crucial component of SOD, which catalyzes the conversion of superoxide radicals into less harmful molecules, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage. Selenium is a vital part of GPxs, enzymes that reduce hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides, preventing the formation of free radicals that can damage cellular structures35,36,37,38,39.\\nThis study has some advantages. Firstly, the integration of data from NHANES serves to bolster the generalizability and practical relevance of our research outcomes. NHANES is widely recognized for its methodological thoroughness and its capability to deliver a sample that precisely represents the U.S. population, encompassing a diverse range of demographic, lifestyle, and health-related variables. This comprehensive dataset enables a thorough analysis of the relationships between CDAI and female infertility, while accounting for potential confounding factors. The inclusion of a diverse population sample allows for the exploration of these relationships across various subgroups. Secondly, the CDAI provides a comprehensive assessment that considers the combined impact of dietary antioxidants, departing from conventional methodologies that typically evaluate individual antioxidants in isolation. This integrated approach is crucial for capturing the synergistic interactions among different antioxidants found in the diet, potentially offering a more accurate representation of actual dietary habits and their influence on health outcomes.\\nThis study is subject to certain limitations. Firstly, the primary limitation arises from the cross-sectional design of the NHANES dataset, which hinders our capacity to establish causal relationships between CDAI and female infertility. Secondly, the reliance on self-reported dietary data in this study introduces the possibility of recall bias and inaccuracies in estimating antioxidant intake. Despite the employment of validated dietary assessment tools, the inherent nature of self-reported data may result in underestimation or overestimation of actual intake, consequently impacting the accuracy of the CDAI calculation and its correlation with infertility outcomes. Thirdly, the study's external validity may be impacted by the demographic and health characteristics of the NHANES participants. Despite NHANES' goal of representing the U.S. population, certain factors related to diet, lifestyle, or healthcare availability may be inadequately recorded or significantly differ from other demographic cohorts. Additionally, although the study's efforts to account for various potential confounders, there remains the possibility of unmeasured variables that could impact the association between dietary antioxidant intake and female infertility. Genetic predispositions and environmental exposures may also have a substantial influence on fertility outcomes, yet were not included in the analysis. Fourthly, a limitation of our study is the broad definition of infertility used in the NHANES database, which relies on self-reported data and does not differentiate between specific causes of infertility, such as PCOS. Although our findings offer insights into the general association between CDAI and female infertility, they do not specifically address the effects of CDAI on women with PCOS. Finally, the CDAI predominantly emphasizes the consumption of antioxidants, potentially overlooking other dietary factors, both nutritional and non-nutritional that may impact female fertility, including dietary fats, sources of protein, and the overall nutritional adequacy of the diet.\\nThis research presents innovative insights into nutritional interventions for addressing female infertility, particularly emphasizing the use of the CDAI as a metric for assessing the overall antioxidant capacity of the diet. The results highlight the role of increased dietary antioxidant intake in reducing the risk of female infertility. Furthermore, these results support the need for additional research on the correlation between dietary antioxidants and women's reproductive health, particularly in light of the potential for dietary modifications to serve as cost-effective preventive measures. This research underscores the significance of dietary antioxidants in preserving women's reproductive health and provides a solid basis for future research and public health interventions. More research is needed to understand how CDAI affects female infertility and how this can be used to develop targeted prevention and treatment strategies.\\nTo ascertain the correlation between dietary antioxidants and female infertility, our investigation utilized the NHANES database. This data comprises a cross-sectional survey intended to evaluate the health and nutrition of individuals in United States40. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the research ethics review board of the National Centre for Health Statistics. All participants in the study provided written informed consent. For the purpose of our study, we extracted data spanning from 2013 to 2018, encompassing a total of 29,400 participants. From this initial population, male participants were excluded from the analysis (n\\u2009=\\u200914,452). Additional exclusions were implemented according to age, specifically individuals under the age of 20 or over the age of 44 years (n\\u2009=\\u200911,241). Subsequent exclusions were based on missing data in several categories critical for our analysis: 373 participants had incomplete demographic information; 481 participants had missing data regarding infertility status; 472 participants had incomplete data for the CDAI calculation; and additional exclusions were made for missing data in key health variables: menarche age (n\\u2009=\\u200911), PID history (n\\u2009=\\u200915), female hormone or birth control pills usage (n\\u2009=\\u20094), as well as medical history including DM, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (n\\u2009=\\u2009121). Lifestyle factors were also considered, with exclusions for missing data in smoking and alcohol use (n\\u2009=\\u200973) and BMI (n\\u2009=\\u200911). The flow chart was presented in Fig. 4.\\nFlowchart of participant selection. NHANES National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, CDAI composite dietary antioxidant index, DM diabetes mellitus, PID pelvic inflammatory disease, BMI body mass index.\\nThe measurement of CDAI\\nDietary information and its components were meticulously gathered by well-trained NHANES personnel. Every participant completed two 24-h dietary recall interviews. Trained data collectors conducted a face-to-face dietary recall for 24 h, followed by a telephone recall 3\\u201310 days later. To reduce bias, the average antioxidant intake over the 2 days was used in the final analysis for a more accurate measure of dietary antioxidant consumption. To calculate the CDAI, we included six dietary antioxidants: vitamin A, C, E, carotenoid, zinc, and selenium. Subsequently, the intake levels for each antioxidant were standardized and summed to the final score. The calculation formula was described in a previous study41.\\nThe definition of female infertility\\nThe assessment of female infertility was conducted through responses to two specific questions in questionnaire: RHQ074 and RHQ076. A positive response to either of these questions qualified a participant as having a history of female infertility42.\\nA range of potential confounders were considered in our analyses to isolate the impact of CDAI on female infertility. These included age, ethnicity, marital status, education, PIR, DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, menarche age, regular period, PID, the use of birth control pills and female hormones, BMI, smoking and drinking status, physical activity, work and recreational activity. Data on these covariates were extracted from the demographics, dietary, examination and questionnaire data, ensuring a comprehensive adjustment for factors that might influence the study outcomes.\\nSample weights were appropriately applied in accordance with the recommended selection criteria to adjust for the intricate survey design of NHANES. For baseline characteristics, Weighted means with standard errors (SE) were utilized for the presentation of continuous variables, while weighted counts (percentages) were employed for the representation of categorical variables. Differences in categorical variables were assessed using the chi-square test, while the Student's t-test was utilized for continuous variables. We explored the association between the CDAI and female infertility using weighted logistic regression models. The participants were stratified into quartiles according to their CDAI levels, with the lowest quartile being designated as the reference group. A trend test was conducted to examine the linear trend across quartiles of CDAI risk estimates. Moreover, RCS was implemented to evaluate potential nonlinear associations between CDAI and female infertility. Sensitivity analyses were conducted through logistic regression within subgroups. Interactions between CDAI and each covariate were also assessed. Statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.3.1), with statistical significance defined as a P value less than 0.05.\\nThe dataset used in this research is available for public access on the NHANES website at [https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/].\\nCarson, S.

(Never heard of oxidative stress? Don\\u2019t worry \\u2014 check out this article, then circle back.) The excellent news: Antioxidants can protect egg and sperm health by helping to balance the antioxidant/oxidative stress see-saw. Let\\u2019s explore the science and review the best antioxidants for boosting female and male fertility.\\nHow do antioxidants impact fertility in females?\\nThere is a delicate balance between antioxidants and oxidative stress in the female reproductive system. As we age, we naturally have more oxidative stress and less cellular energy production. Unfortunately, with age also comes more abnormal chromosomes in women's eggs, plus cervical fluid changes, which impact a woman's chances of having a viable pregnancy.\\nHowever, advancing age doesn\\u2019t always result in infertility or subfertility, and even young women of ideal reproductive age can have vastly different egg quality. It\\u2019s highly variable and specific to the individual. These changes are not only a result of aging and don\\u2019t necessarily develop slowly over a lifetime. Instead, most chromosomal errors occur shortly before ovulation due to oxidative stress damage to the mitochondria, the body's energy-producing \\\"battery.\\u201d This is where antioxidants come in.\\nAntioxidants have been shown to improve and protect egg and sperm quality, support the body\\u2019s free radical defenses and maintain DNA integrity. Eggs develop many months before ovulation occurs in a process known as folliculogenesis. During this process, antioxidants like glutathione, the master antioxidant, shield eggs from damage caused by oxidative stress (1). Glutathione also helps produce healthier eggs and more robust embryos in women undergoing IVF (1). In addition, eggs of higher quality with better DNA integrity are more likely to implant successfully. Optimizing your egg quality through food and supplements can elevate, protect, and preserve your fertility.\\nHow do antioxidants impact fertility for males?\\nLike eggs, sperm function, including quantity, motility (movement), and morphology (structure), also depend on balancing the body's antioxidant activity and oxidative stress. For example, the seminal plasma, or the fluid portion of semen, contains a rich source of antioxidants that protect the sperm against oxidative stress, one of the main contributing factors to male infertility. You may have guessed, but when there is too much oxidative stress or reduced antioxidant protection, this can reduce fertility potential.\\nSperm, on the other hand, needs antioxidants like glutathione to form the midpiece of its mitochondria (2). When the body isn't producing enough glutathione, it can impact sperm motility or its ability to travel efficiently to the egg (1) (2). In addition, antioxidants can help restore the structure and function of the cell membrane and maintain DNA integrity, particularly in men with high levels of DNA fragmentation (3).\\nOne important point to note is that even if there is no evidence of abnormal sperm quality on a semen analysis, there is still a significant benefit to taking lifestyle measures to optimize sperm health. This is because not everything can be measured on a semen analysis, and sperm are constantly being made and developing.\\nnormal forward movement\\nWhich antioxidants are safe and beneficial for egg and sperm quality?\\nWhile our body can make antioxidants, the modern environment (along with our bodies' natural cellular processes) makes it challenging to keep the balance of antioxidants and oxidative stress in check. The good thing is that several well-studied antioxidants can improve and protect egg and sperm quality.\\nAlpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA)\\nAlpha-lipoic acid, or ALA, is a fertility-supporting antioxidant with protective and restorative effects on eggs and sperm. In women, it supports egg cell maturation through fertilization to embryo development (4). In men, it helps improve sperm count (the total number of sperm in a sample or one ejaculate), concentration (the number of sperm in one milliliter of semen), motility, and levels of antioxidants in the sperm (5), which helps to maintain DNA integrity (6).\\nCoenzyme Q10, or CoQ10, is a superstar antioxidant for both egg and sperm quality. Though most CoQ10 is made by the body, levels naturally decline with age and even the highest food sources may not be enough to influence levels adequately. In fact, very little is found in food sources and the body\\u2019s needs can exceed the amount that we make or consume. It\\u2019s a highly individualized process.\\nFor women, CoQ10 is essential in boosting an egg's battery or mitochondrial function. The better the mitochondrial function, the easier it is for eggs to produce more energy, which helps support egg maturation, fertilization, and embryo development. For men, CoQ10 circulates in the testis and sperm, and in research, it has been shown to support healthy sperm motility (7).\\nAshwagandha is an adaptogenic herb with potent antioxidant properties that support a healthy and balanced response to stress. Long durations of stress can impact every stage of fertility. As cortisol levels rise, the ability of our body to produce the hormones we need to support optimal fertility decrease and, in turn, impact the quality of our eggs and sperm.\\nNot only can Ashwagandha promote calm, clarity, relaxation, and a healthy stress response, but it helps maintain normal cortisol levels. For men, its impact extends even further. It has the added benefit of improving sperm count, motility, and morphology while also supporting the body\\u2019s free radical defenses and maintaining DNA integrity.\\nN-acetyl cysteine (NAC)\\nN-acetyl cysteine, or NAC, the supplement form of cysteine, is an amino acid that helps the body create and use protective antioxidants like glutathione. While you may be familiar with NAC for its role in immune and respiratory health, it also plays an essential role in fertility.\\nFor women undergoing assisted reproductive efforts, NAC supplementation has been shown to support follicle development (10). It also has the added benefit of helping ovulation, oocyte maturation, embryo quality, and more favorable hormone levels in women with PCOS (11). For men with fertility problems, research has shown that supplementing NAC daily for at least three months is linked to healthier sperm function and higher sperm counts (12). A win-win!\\nSelenium is a trace mineral with antioxidant properties essential in both male and female fertility. In men, selenium supports sperm maturation while supporting the body\\u2019s free radical defenses, improving and protecting sperm quality.(13). Selenium also improves sperm parameters, including motility and morphology (14). In female fertility, selenium promotes healthy thyroid hormone creation, healthy blood sugar levels, and healthy birth weights for baby (15).\\nZinc, another essential nutrient for fertility, is a critical player in supporting healthy sperm DNA creation and sperm parameters like motility and concentration (16). Its antioxidant-like properties help promote healthy hormone levels in men and women, supporting immune function and healthy, full-term births (17).\\nHow to Increase Your Fertility Boosting Antioxidants\\nDiet is the first way to get more antioxidants into your body. Eating nutrient-dense foods like cruciferous vegetables, grass-fed meats, nuts, and seeds, will flood your body with various nutrients needed for optimal antioxidant levels.\\nThough we are food-first advocates here at FullWell, we understand that supplementing is needed more often than not to help enhance our fertility in our modern environments that do such an excellent job at depleting it. That's why we expertly formulated FullWell's range of supplements to support every aspect of your fertility.\\nStart by choosing your prenatal:\\nMen\\u2019s Multivitamin | Our Men\\u2019s Multivitamin and Mineral complex\\nWomen\\u2019s Prenatal Multivitamin | Our Women\\u2019s Prenatal Vitamin and Mineral supplement designed specifically for women before, during, and after pregnancy.\\nSTART WITH THE BASICS...\\n...FOR BOTH PARTNERS.\\nAdd on our new Fertility Booster, a first-of-its-kind supplement specifically designed to provide optimal nutrients for BOTH egg and sperm health for those who are:\\nTrying to conceive or planning to start a family soon\\nUndergoing fertility treatment\\nLooking to improve sperm quality before freezing their eggs or sperm\\nProtecting their fertility for the future\\nTurn on a firehose of antioxidant power.\\n\\u201cOur advice?

Key points include:\\n\\n1. **Study Overview**: The research involved 2162 female participants to assess dietary antioxidant intake through two 24-hour dietary recall interviews. Female infertility was evaluated via self-reported questionnaires.\\n\\n2. **Findings**: The study found that women with infertility had lower CDAI scores compared to those without infertility. After adjusting for confounding variables, a significant negative association (P=0.016) was observed between higher CDAI levels and the risk of female infertility, indicating that greater antioxidant consumption may lower the risk.\\n\\n3. **Statistical Methods**: Logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline analysis were employed, confirming a linear negative correlation between CDAI and infertility.\\n\\n4. **Subgroup Analysis**: The association held across various demographic and lifestyle factors, although interactions were not statistically significant. Notably, the relationship was more pronounced in groups such as those with an earlier menarche age.\\n\\n5. **Mechanisms**: The study discusses the role of oxidative stress (OS) in reproductive health and suggests that dietary antioxidants could mitigate oxidative damage, positively influencing fertility.\\n\\n6. **Limitations**: The cross-sectional design limits the ability to infer causation, and reliance on self-reported dietary data introduces potential bias. The broad definition of infertility and the focus on antioxidants may overlook other dietary factors affecting fertility.\\n\\n7. **Conclusion**: The research highlights the potential protective role of dietary antioxidants against female infertility, advocating for further prospective studies to confirm these results and explore dietary modifications as a means of improving reproductive health.\\n\\nOverall, the study emphasizes the significance of dietary antioxidants in women's reproductive health and suggests that higher antioxidant intake may be linked to a reduced risk of infertility.\",\n          \"The document discusses the role of antioxidants in enhancing fertility for both men and women, emphasizing their importance in improving and protecting egg and sperm quality, supporting free radical defenses, and maintaining DNA integrity.

The study included 125 women diagnosed with reduced ovarian reserves (case group) and 125 women with normal ovarian reserves (control group). Dietary intake was assessed via a food frequency questionnaire, and DAI was calculated to estimate the antioxidant capacity of their diets.\n",

              "\n",
              "1. **Nutrient Intake Discrepancies**: Infertile women demonstrated lower intakes of several key nutrients, including potassium, magnesium, copper, vitamin C, and fiber, while having a higher cholesterol intake compared to the control group. \n",
              "\n",
              "2. **Negative Association of DAI with Infertility**: A significant negative association between DAI and infertility was observed, with higher DAI scores correlating with lower infertility risk, even after adjustment for confounding factors such as age and BMI.\n",
              "\n",
              "3. **Implications**: The study suggests that a diet rich in antioxidants can potentially reduce the risk of infertility in women. It emphasizes the importance of adequate intake of dietary antioxidants for reproductive health.\n",
              "\n",
              "4. **Recommendations for Future Research**: The authors advocate for more longitudinal studies to confirm these findings and to explore the underlying mechanisms through which antioxidants influence fertility.\n",
